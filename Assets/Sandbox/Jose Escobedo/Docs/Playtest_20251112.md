# Notes from Jose E.

- Playtester David
- Help page is empty.
- The enemy does not move from his spot.
- The player can go through walls and doors.
- The player cannot be seen behind the walls of a back room.
- The boss does not spawn.
    - The boss is still being worked on.
- The player can walk out of bounds.
    - It has never been fixed after any playtesting sessions.
- The main manu does not work after returning from the pause menu.
- If you are changing time scale to zero in the pause menu, it is bad.
- The hierarchy is horrendous. Everyone needs to organize. The hierarchy tab is important and things should not be floating out in space.
- The boss now works after a refresh.
- The boss should be six times bigger than displayed on the playtest.
