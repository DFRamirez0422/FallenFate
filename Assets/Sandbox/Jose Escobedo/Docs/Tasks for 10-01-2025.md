# Enemy Systems

Owner: Nathan White

Task: Edit `hitstun.cs`

## Details:

- Current Issue:
    - Hitstun currently does not prevent enemies from attacking while being hit
- New Behaviors to Implement:
    - Pre-Attack Phase:
        - When enemies enter attack range, they should enter an "about-to-attack" phase
        - They must wait X seconds before performing the attack
    - Hitstun Recovery:
        - After hitstun ends, enemies enter a recovery phase
        - During recovery, they must wait X seconds before resuming attack logic
