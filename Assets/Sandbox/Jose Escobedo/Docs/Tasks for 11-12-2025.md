While in and out of combat, Elena will automatically pick up items throughout the levels. These items would be dropped after enemies are killed or found naturally throughout the world.

1. Item is dropped by enemy or located in the game world.
2. Elena automatically goes to the item
3. Quick Time Event prompt appears on the screen with Elena dialogue "Damien, catch!"
4. If prompt pressed, item is caught and added to player inventory for use at will.

Program the logic for what happens when the players succeeds or fails the QTE prompt.
