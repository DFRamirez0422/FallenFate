## Conditions of Satisfaction:

- [ ] Player actions (attacks, movement, dodges, etc.) respond accurately and smoothly
- [ ] Combat mechanics (damage, combos, hit detection) function correctly and consistently
- [ ] Integration with enemy AI and environmental interactions is seamless
- [ ] Visual and audio feedback correctly represent player actions
- [ ] Systems are tested for balance, performance, and reliability across all gameplay scenarios

Due date: Monday

## Eric:

- [x] Add player translation to attack data sets, such as with the player moving forward when attacking
- [ ] Adding to the hit stun component like an actual knockback or better feedback for hitting the enemy
- [ ] Fixing the perry and block system. Removing the rhythm attached to it.
- [ ] The backfire finisher needs to have a lasting hitback in the end while the guitar is spinning to hold the enemy while stunned. Example would be like Pit from Smash Bros.
