SoundFXManager – Usage Guide

Setup
- Create an empty GameObject in your scene named 'SoundFXManager'.
- Attach the SoundFXManager script to the object.
- Add an AudioSource component (or let the script create one automatically).
- Assign your AudioClip assets to the 'Clips' array in the inspector.
- Check 'DontDestroyOnLoad' is enabled by default (persistent across scenes).

Playing Sounds
- Use the static method `SoundFXManager.Play("ClipName")` to play a sound.
- Optionally add volume and pitch variation:
  `SoundFXManager.Play("ClipName", 0.8f, 0.1f)`
- The clip name must match the AudioClip’s name in the 'Clips' array.

Random Sounds
- For random variation (e.g., footsteps):
  `SoundFXManager.PlayRandom(new string[] { "Step1", "Step2", "Step3" })`

3D Sounds
- To play a sound at a specific world position:
  `SoundFXManager.PlayAtPosition("Explosion", transform.position)`

Stopping Sounds
- Stop all currently playing sounds:
  `SoundFXManager.Stop()`

Notes
- The manager automatically initializes itself as a singleton.
- It persists between scenes.
- Use lowercase or exact matching names for clip lookups.
- Ensure only one SoundFXManager exists in your project.
